### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/hadzicni/powershell-scripts-collection.git
   cd powershell-scripts-collection
   ```

2. **Set execution policy (if needed):**

   cd Scripts
   ```

### Usage Examples

#### Active Directory Operations

```powershell
# Add users from file to AD group
.\ActiveDirectory\Add-UsersToGroupFromFile.ps1 -UserListPath "users.txt" -TargetGroupName "IT_Department"

# Export group members to Excel
.\ActiveDirectory\Export-GroupMembers.ps1 -GroupName "IT_Department" -OutputPath "members.xlsx"

# Validate group memberships

## üìö Script Documentation

Each script includes comprehensive help documentation. Use `Get-Help` to view detailed information:

```powershell
Get-Help .\ActiveDirectory\Add-UsersToGroupFromFile.ps1 -Full
Get-Help .\SystemAdmin\Monitor-WindowsService.ps1 -Examples
```

---

## üîí Security Considerations

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Run scripts with minimum required permissions
- **Credential Handling**: Use secure credential objects, avoid plain text passwords
- **Input Validation**: All scripts include input validation and sanitization
- **Logging**: Sensitive operations are logged for audit purposes
- **Testing**: Always test scripts in a non-production environment first
